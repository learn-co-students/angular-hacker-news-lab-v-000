    text:"To everyone complaining about the $250K (see edit, it&#x27;s actually 200K) per person in salary (which seems to be everyone at the moment), a few things to keep in mind:<p>1) That includes benefits<p>2) They are in Silicon Valley and have to compete with everyone else in Silicon Valley<p>3) Given what they have accomplished with such a small team, these are probably high caliber people.<p>4) In SV there is a good 25% premium you pay for engineers with security expertise.<p>As someone who runs a business and has to hire talent, I can say that I&#x27;d consider myself lucky to get such a team for such a great price.<p>Edit:  A bunch of people are saying &quot;why not remote&quot;.  I think they are in fact mostly remote, but they still have to <i>compete</i> with SV wages because really good people command those wages whether they are here or not.<p>Edit2:  As has been pointed out multiple times, the blog post was not clear, and it is actually 200K per person, all in."
