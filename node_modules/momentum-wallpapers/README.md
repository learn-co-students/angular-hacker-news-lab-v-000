[Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca) is a great extension for Chrome, what it does is replacing your new tab page with a new one featuring a beautiful background that changes every day, the backgrounds are so amazing that I always end up making them as my desktop wallpaper, unfortunately there isn't an option in the extension to change the desktop wallpaper everyday automatically, so I made this little Node.js app that does just that.

Momentum stores the path for the background in Chrome's local stroage, local storage is basically sqlite, so it can be accessed outside Chrome.
